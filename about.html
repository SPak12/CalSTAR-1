Cal Space Technologies and Rocketry Team) is an emerging team looking to compete in <b> NASA's Student Launch Initiative </b>. Our beginning plans consist of <b> team growth </b> and <b> obtaining certification </b> for launching rockets. By the end of 2016, we hope to be on our way to launching our very own rocket. As the team grows and establishes itself, we hope to do <b> research </b> in the fields of space, technology, and rocketry. We would also like to reach out to the community of Berkeley and the Bay Area to <b> establish an aerospace community </b> that doesn't exist currently. <b> This is just the beginnng! </b> </div>
